Introduction
----------
	This "Elletourage iOS app" is a proof-of-concept and technology demonstrator.
	It is built using React-Native, 
	
Requirements
----------
	Node modules:
	
	React
	React-Native
	React-Native-Checkbox
	React-Native-Maps
	React-Native-Deprecated-Custom-Components
	React-Native-ALertiOS
	
	
Installation
----------
	(See online tutorial for environment setup)
	"facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html"


Troubleshooting
----------
 * Promise rejection exceptions are caused by malformed Async operations. Check the code for API calls or AsyncStorage calls
 
FAQ
---
 * While it is technically cross-platform, the use of platform-specific components prevents full functionality (MapView and iOS timepicker especially)

 * This app was tested on the iPhone 6 emulator. Smaller screens caused rendering errors. Larger screens appear to be unaffected.
